# Walk-through-warehouse

My past external work for the Dufeksoft, s.r.o. company.
This code was designed for purpose of making it easier for warehouse workers of the takfajn.sk eshop to pick all chosen products in different quotes in an organized, continuous line between different storage shelves, rows, and columns.
